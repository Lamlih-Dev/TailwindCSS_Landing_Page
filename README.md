# Landing Page using HTML, CSS, JS, and TailwindCSS
After learning and mastering bootstrap, i want to try other css frameworks, so i picked tailwind css for today !
This is a Frontend Mentor intermediate challenge where i learned and practiced tailwind css, i think it's a good css framework 
and it's pretty much like bootstrap with some small differences. So yeah i think i'll use it in my projects in the future.<br>
